--- abstract

This specification defines a mechanism through which an OAuth client can
identify itself to authorization servers, without prior dynamic client
registration or other existing registration. This is through the usage of a URL
as a `client_id` in an OAuth flow, where the URL refers to a document containing
the necessary client metadata, enabling the authorization server to fetch the
metadata about the client as needed.

# Introduction

In order for an OAuth 2.0 {{RFC6749}} client to utilize an OAuth 2.0
authorization server, the client needs to establish a unique identifier, and
needs to to provide the server with metadata about the application, such as the
application name, icon and redirect URIs. In cases where a client is interacting
with authorization servers that it has no relationship with, manual registration
is impossible.

While Dynamic Client Registration {{RFC7591}} can provide a method for a
previously unknown client to establish itself at an authorization server and
obtain a client identifier, this is not always practical in some deployments and
can create additional challenges around management of the registration data and
cleanup of inactive clients.

This specification describes how an OAuth 2.0 client can publish its
own registration information and avoid the need for pre-registering
at each authorization server.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Client Identifier

This specification defines the client identifier as a URL with the following
restrictions. Client identifier URLs MUST have an "https" scheme, MUST contain a
path component, MUST NOT contain single-dot or double-dot path segments, MUST
NOT contain a fragment component and MUST NOT contain a username or password
Client identifier URLs SHOULD NOT include a query string component, and MAY contain a port.

This specification places no restrictions on what URL is used as
a client identifier. A short URL is RECOMMENDED, since the URL may
be displayed to the end user in the authorization interface or in
management interfaces. Usage of a stable URL that does not frequently
change for the client is also RECOMMENDED.

# Client Information Discovery

One purpose of registering clients at the authorization server is so that
the authorization server has additional information about the client that
can be used during an OAuth flow, such as presenting information about
the client to the user in an authorization consent screen, for example the
client name and logo.

The authorization server SHOULD fetch the document indicated by the `client_id`
to retrieve the client registration information.

## Client Metadata

The client metadata document URL is a JSON document containing the metadata
of the client. The client metadata values are the values defined in
the OAuth Dynamic Client Registration Metadata OAuth Parameters registry
<https://www.iana.org/assignments/oauth-parameters/oauth-parameters.xhtml#client-metadata>.

The client metadata document MUST be served with a 200 OK HTTP status code
as defined in {{RFC9110}} Section 15.3.1.

The client metadata document MUST contain a `client_id` property whose value
MUST compare and match the URL of the document using simple string comparison
as defined in {{RFC3986}} Section 6.2.1.

The client metadata document MAY define additional properties in the response.
The client metadata document MAY also be served with more specific content types
as long as the response is JSON and conforms to `application/<AS-defined>+json`.

As there is no way to establish a shared secret to be used with client metadata
documents, the following restrictions apply on the contents of the
client metadata document:

* the `token_endpoint_auth_method` property MUST NOT include `client_secret_post`
or `client_secret_basic`
* the `client_secret` and `client_secret_expires_at` properties MUST NOT be used

See {{client_authentication}} for more details.

Other specifications MAY place additional restrictions on the contents of the
client metadata document accepted by authorization servers implementing their
specification, for instance, preventing the registration of confidential clients
by requiring the `token_endpoint_auth_method` property be set to `"none"`.

The response for a client metadata document MAY return the `Expires` header, as
defined in  {{RFC9111}}, to indicate to an Authorization Server that the
client metadata document has a limited lifetime, and consequently, so does the
OAuth Client created from the document. If the client metadata document cannot
be re-fetched by the Authorization Server after the `Expires` time, then the
Authorization Server MUST treat that `client_id` as being an `unauthorized_client`.

### Client Metadata Documents for Development Use {#documents_for_development}

When developing applications against a service that use this internet draft,
developers often encounter the issue of “how do I serve a client metadata document
at a `https` URL whilst developing my application?”.

For this purpose, it is recommended to use a service that generates and hosts client
metadata documents for development purposes.

A service that generates client metadata documents for development purposes SHOULD
use short stable URLs, i.e., MUST NOT derive the contents of the document from query
parameters, and MUST return a HTTP `Expires` header with the response.

Alternatively, a developer may to upload the client metadata document to any publicly
accessible URL with HTTPS, with the contents describing the client for local development
(e.g., using the localhost hostname in its `redirect_uris`), if you do this, you may
want to consider setting the HTTP Expires header to indicate expiration of your client
to the authorization server.

An authorization server MAY place additional restrictions on the contents of client
metadata documents, such as only allowing non-public hostnames in the `redirect_uris`
if the client metadata document is from a trusted origin.

## Metadata Discovery Errors

If fetching the metadata document fails, the authorization server SHOULD abort the
authorization request.

## Metadata Caching

The authorization server MAY cache the client metadata it discovers at the
client metadata document URL.

TBD: recommend a cache lifetime? considerations about stale data?

The authorization server MUST NOT cache error responses. The authorization
server also MUST NOT cache documents which are invalid or malformed.

TBD: Do we want to define an endpoint through which a document can be validated
by an authorization server, such that a developer can assert that their document
is valid?

## Redirect URL Registration

According to {{I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics}}, the authorization server
MUST require registration of redirect URIs, and MUST ensure that the redirect URI
in a request is an exact match of a registered redirect URI.

This method of client information discovery establishes a
registered redirect URI with the authorization server which is used when
comparing the redirect URI in an authorization request against the registered
redirect URIs.

# Authorization Server Metadata {#as-metadata}

Authorization servers that publish Authorization Server Metadata {{RFC8414}} MUST include the following property to signal support for client metadata documents as described in this specification.

`client_id_metadata_document_supported`:
: OPTIONAL. Boolean value specifying whether the authorization server supports retrieving client metadata from a `client_id` URL as described in this specification.

This enables clients to avoid sending the user to a dead end, by only redirecting the user to an authorization server that supports this specification. Otherwise, the client would redirect the user and the user would be met with an error about an invalid client as described by Section 4.1.2.1 of {{RFC6749}}.


# Security Considerations

In addition to the security considerations in OAuth 2.0 Core {{RFC6749}}, and OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations {{RFC6819}}, and {{I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics}} the additional considerations apply.

## Client Authentication {#client_authentication}

Since the client establishes its own registration data at the authorization server,
prior coordination of client credentials is not possible. However, clients MAY establish
credentials at the authorization server by using authentication methods that use
public/private key pairs, by publishing the public key in their metadata document.

For example, the client MAY include the following properties in its metadata document
to establish a public key and the `private_key_jwt` authentication method defined in {{OpenID}}:

    {
      ...
      "token_endpoint_auth_method": "private_key_jwt",
      "jwks_uri": "https://client.example.com/jwks.json"
      ...
    }

This establishes this client as a confidential client, and any communication with
the authorization server MUST include client authentication of the registered type.

## OAuth Phishing Attacks

Authorization servers SHOULD fetch the `client_id` metadata document provided in the authorization request in order to provide users with additional information about the request, such as the application name and logo. If the server does not fetch the client metadata document, then it SHOULD take additional measures to ensure the user is provided with as much information as possible about the request.

The authorization server SHOULD display the hostname of the `client_id` on the authorization interface, in addition to displaying the fetched client information if any. Displaying the hostname helps users know that they are authorizing the expected application.

If fetching the client metadata document fails for any reason, the `client_id` URL is the only piece of information the user has as an indication of which application they are authorizing.


## Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Attacks

Authorization servers fetching the client metadata document and resolving URLs located in the metadata document should be aware of possible SSRF attacks. Authorization servers SHOULD avoid fetching any URLs using private or loopback addresses and consider network policies or other measures to prevent making requests to these addresses. Authorization servers SHOULD also be aware of the possibility that URLs might be non-http-based URI schemes which can lead to other possible SSRF attack vectors.


## Maximum Response Size for Client Metadata Documents

Authorization servers SHOULD limit the response size when fetching the client metadata document, as to avoid denial of service attacks against the authorization server by consuming excessive resources (memory, disk, database). The recommended maximum response size for client metadata documents is 5 kilobytes.


## Displaying Logos to End-Users

Authorization servers that wish to make use of the `logo_uri` property within client metadata document SHOULD prefetch the file at `logo_uri` and cache it for the cache duration of the client metadata document. This allows for moderation tools to verify the file contents (e.g., preventing usage of logos that look like other logos), as well as preventing the logo from being dynamically changed to confuse an end-user.

Caching of the `logo_uri` response can additionally prevent cross-domain tracking through the `logo_uri` being requested by the client, since the cached file would be served not from the remote URI but instead from a URI that the Authorization server trusts.

# IANA Considerations

## OAuth Authorization Server Metadata Registry

The following authorization server metadata value is defined by this specification and registered in the IANA "OAuth Authorization Server Metadata" registry established in OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata [RFC8414].

* Metadata Name: `client_id_metadata_document_supported`:
* Metadata Description: JSON boolean value specifying whether the authorization server supports retrieving client metadata from a `client_id` URL.
* Change Controller: IETF
* Specification Document: {{as-metadata}} of {{&SELF}}

# Acknowledgments
{:numbered="false"}

The idea of using URIs as the `client_id` in OAuth based authorization requests is not new, and has previously been specified in varying ways by [IndieAuth], [Solid-OIDC], and [OpenID.Federation]. This specification is largely inspired by the work of Aaron Coburn, elf Pavlik, and Dmitri Zagidulin in their [Solid-OIDC] specification which defined dereferenceable Client Identifier Documents.

The authors would like to thank the following people for their contributions and reviews of this specification: Dick Hardt, Matthieu Sieben.

* Added prohibition on the `client_secret_expires_at` property, as it is not relevant for Client ID Metadata Documents.
* Added security consideration for development use-cases.

-01
