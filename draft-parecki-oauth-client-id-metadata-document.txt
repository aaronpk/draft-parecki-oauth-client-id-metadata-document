                   OAuth Client ID Metadata Document
         draft-parecki-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines an endpoint an OAuth client can use to
   host its client metadata, as well as the use of this URL as a
   client_id in an OAuth flow.  This enables OAuth clients to work with
   authorization servers where it has no prior relationship, and enables
   the authorization server to fetch metadata about the client.

1.  Introduction

   In order for an OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] client to utilize an OAuth 2.0
   authorization server, the client needs to establish a unique
   identifier, and needs to to provide the server with metadata about
   the application, such as the application name and icon.  In cases
   where a client is interacting with authorization servers that it has
   no relationship with, manual registration is impossible.

   While Dynamic Client Registration [RFC7591] can provide a method for
   a previously unknown client to establish itself at an authorization
   server and obtain a client idenfier, this is not always practical in
   some deployments and can create additional challenges around
   management of the registration data and cleanup of inactive clients.

   This specification describes how an OAuth 2.0 client can publish its
   own registration information and avoid the need for pre-registering
   at each authorization server.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Client Identifier

   This specification defines the client identifier as a URL with the
   following restrictions.  Client identifier URLs MUST have an "https"
   scheme, MUST contain a path component, MUST NOT contain single-dot or
   double-dot path segments, MAY contain a query string component, MUST
   NOT contain a fragment component, MUST NOT contain a username or
   password component, and MAY contain a port.

   This specification places no restrictions on what URL is used as a
   client identifier.  A short URL is RECOMMENDED, since the URL may be
   displayed to the end user in the authorization interface or in
   management interfaces.

4.  Client Information Discovery

   One purpose of registering clients at the authorization server is so
   that the authorziation server has additional information about the
   client that can be used during an OAuth flow, such as presenting
   information about the client to the user in an authorziation consent
   screen, for example the client name and logo.

   The authorization server SHOULD fetch the document indicated by the
   client_id to retrieve the client registration information.

4.1.  Client Metadata

   The client metadata document URL is a JSON document containing the
   metadata of the client.  The client metadata values are the values
   defined in OAuth Dynamic Client Registration ([RFC7591]) section 2.

4.2.  Metadata Discovery Errors

   If fetching the metadata document fails, the authorization server MAY
   abort the authorization request, or continue with the information it
   has available.

4.3.  Redirect URL Registration

   According to [I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics], the
   authorization server MUST require registration of redirect URLs, and
   compare redirect URLs with exact string matching.  This client
   information discovery establishes a registered redirect URL with the
   authorization server which is used when comparing the redirect URL in
   an authorization request against the registered redirect URLs.

4.4.  Metadata Caching

   The authorization server MAY cache the client information it
   discovers at the metadata document URL.

   TBD: recommend a cache lifetime? considerations about stale data?

5.  Security Considerations

   In addition to the security considerations in OAuth 2.0 Core
   [RFC6749], and OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations
   [RFC6819], and [I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics] the additional
   considerations apply.

5.1.  Public vs Confidential Clients

   Since the client establishes its own registration data at the
   authorization server, prior coordination of client credentials is not
   possible.  However, clients MAY establish credentials at the
   authorization server by using authentication methods that use public/
   private key pairs, by publishing the public key in their metadata
   document.

   For example, the client MAY include the following properties in its
   metadata document to establish a public key and the private_key_jwt
   authentication method:

   {
     ...
     "token_endpoint_auth_method": "private_key_jwt",
     "jwks_uri": "https://client.example.com/jwks.json"
     ...
   }

   This establishes this client as a confidential client, and any
   communication with the authorization server MUST include client
   authentication of the registered type.

5.2.  OAuth Phishing Attacks

   Authorization servers SHOULD fetch the client_id metadata document
   provided in the authorization request in order to provide users with
   additional information about the request, such as the application
   name and logo.  If the server does not fetch the client information,
   then it SHOULD take additional measures to ensure the user is
   provided with as much information as possible about the request.

   The authorization server SHOULD display the hostname of the client_id
   on the authorization interface, in addition to displaying the fetched
   client information if any.  Displaying the hostname helps users know
   that they are authorizing the expected application.

   If fetching the client metadata fails for any reason, the client_id
   URL is the only piece of information the user has as an indication of
   which application they are authorizing.

5.3.  Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Attacks

   Authorization servers fetching the client metadata document and
   resolving URLs located in the metadata document should be aware of
   possible SSRF attacks.  Authorization servers SHOULD avoid fetching
   any URLs using private or loopback addresses and consider network
   policies or other measures to prevent making requests to these
   addresses.  Authorization servers SHOULD also be aware of the
   possibility that URLs might be non-http-based URI schemes which can
   lead to other possible SSRF attack vectors.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
